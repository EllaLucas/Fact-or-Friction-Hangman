# Fact-or-Friction-Hangman
I created an interactive game of Hangman with an interesting twist - instead of guessing a generic word, I modified the game so that an obscure fact will be revealed.   The program tracks remaining lives numerically rather than visually.  You have 5 chances to correctly guess the fact or it's game over. Total lives granted is a small number to normalize the difficulty compared to traditional Hangman. There exists larger variation in letters represented in a phrase compared to a single word.
